# ðŸ“„ Resume Shortlisting Predictor

**Predict your chances of getting shortlisted â€” and receive personalized feedback to enhance your resume.**

This project simulates how companies might use data to evaluate resumes. It allows users to input resume-related details like skills, education background, experience type, and target company, then predicts shortlisting probability using a trained machine learning model.  
Alongside the prediction, the app also provides actionable suggestions based on feature importance â€” helping users understand what could make their profile stronger.

> âš¡ Built as a hands-on learning project to explore real-world machine learning workflows with simple UI deployment.

## ðŸ§ª Note

This project is built for **learning purposes**, not to replicate or endorse automated hiring decisions. Real-world recruitment involves far more complexity, fairness considerations, and human judgment.
